Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software to address user needs.

security - software rngineering through  protection practices like two way authentication, authorization and data encryption has ensured that user information is secured.

produtivity -  it helps to improve team workflow and creates an environment where teams can collaborate, communicate and  maintain quality standards in resource output and utilization.

research and innovation - Software engineering the tech industry in research and innovation by providing the tools and methodologies to develop complex systems, prototypes.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Programming languages - Mordern programming languages has made it easy to give instructions to the computer

World Wide Web - The development of the world wide web enabled the creation of web applications

Graphcal user interface (GUI) - The creation Graphical User Interface made it easier to interact with the computer through graphical icons instead of text-based UIs, which are based on typed command.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 - Requirements: Gathering information on user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating detailed software architecture and friendly user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Testing software to ensure the software meets quality standards, design and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
